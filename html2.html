<h1><center><u>PYTHON</u></center></h1>
<ol type="A">
<li> What is Python?</li>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, andhigh-level programming language.</li>
<li>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</li>
<li>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming language. Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</li>
</ul><br>
<li> Python Jobs</li> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today a Python Programmer with 3-5 years of experience is asking for around $150,000
annual package and this is the most demanding programming language in America. Though it can
vary depending on the location of the Job. It's impossible to list all of the companies using Python,
to name a few big companies are:
<ul type="disc"><br>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Intel</li>
<li>NASA</li>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>IBM</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>Pintrest</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>Many more...</li><br>
</ul>
<li> Why to Learn Python?</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many good reasons which makes Python as the top choice of any programmer:
<ul type="ring"><br>
<li>Python is Open Source which means its available free of cost.</li>
<li>Python is simple and so easy to learn</li>
<li>Python is versatile and can be used to create many different things.</li>
<li>Python has powerful development libraries include AI, ML etc.</li>
<li>Python is much in demand and ensures high salary</li>
</ul><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software
Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of
the key advantages of learning Python:
<ol type="i"><br>
<li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to
compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
<li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
<li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of
programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
<li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level
programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text
processing to WWW browsers to games.</li><br>
</ol>
<li> Careers with Python</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know Python nicely, then you have a great career ahead. Here are just a few of the
career options where Python is a key skill:
<ul type="square"><br>
<li>Game developer</li>
<li>Web designer</li>
<li>Python developer</li>
<li>Full-stack developer</li>
<li>Machine learning engineer</li>
<li>Data scientist</li>
<li>Data analyst</li>
<li>Data engineer</li>
<li>DevOps engineer</li>
<li>Software engineer</li>
<li>Many more other roles</li>
</ul>
<li>Characteristics of Python</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −
<ol type="1">
<li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
<li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
<li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
<li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
<li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
</ol>
<li>Applications of Python</li>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy-to-learn</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows the student to pick up the language quickly</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy-to-read</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy-to-maintain</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad standard library</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows, and Macintosh</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactive Mode</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debugging of snippets of code.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portable</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface<dr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all platforms.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extendable</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efficient.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Databases</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GUI Programming</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Window system of Unix.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scalable</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scripting.</dd>
